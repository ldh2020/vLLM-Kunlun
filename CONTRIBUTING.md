## Contributing

Please refer to the
[CONTRIBUTING guide](https://vllm-kunlun.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/contribution/index.html)

## Issues

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, and other public discussions.

### Search Existing Issues First

Before opening a new issue, please search through existing issues to check whether
a similar bug report or feature request already exists. This helps avoid duplicates
and keeps discussions focused.

### Reporting New Issues

When opening a new issue, please provide as much information as possible, such as:
- A clear and detailed problem description  
- Relevant logs or error messages  
- Code snippets, screenshots, or videos if applicable  

The more context you provide, the easier it will be for maintainers to diagnose and resolve the issue.

## Pull Requests

We strongly welcome pull requests to help improve vLLM Kunlun.

### Submitting Pull Requests

All pull requests will be reviewed by the maintainers. Automated checks and tests
will be run as part of the review process. Once all checks pass and the review is
approved, the pull request will be accepted. Please note that merging into the
`main` branch may not happen immediately and could be subject to scheduling.

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure that:

1. You fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. You update relevant code comments or documentation if APIs are changed.
3. You add the appropriate copyright notice to the top of any new files.
